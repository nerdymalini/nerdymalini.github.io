# Can a fintech startup disrupt retail trading in Australia

If you have ever looked into what it takes to buy or trade in the stock market, you would have encountered platforms like Commsec, Stake and Trading View. When I did, I was viewing them both as a customer and also as fellow digital products builder. With my product builder hat on, my initial impression was: Holy barrier to entry Batman! Just look at how many features these platforms provide! 

But time has allowed me to more clearly distinguish my customer impressions from my product analysis perspectives. And I think I've done a 180° on that initial impression, and am now of the view that a lean, hyper-focused fintech may well be able to disrupt the Australian retail trading landscape.

# Is the juice worth the squeeze

Let's begin by considering who the target customer would be, and based on that what the total addressable market size could look like.&#x20;

The proposed target customer would be someone who:

* wants their funds to do more than attract average savings interest rates,
* may be locked out of the housing market but has built up a nest egg while saving for the property deposit,
* is aware of the power of capital markets but may not be fluent in investment or trading knowledge,
* wants quicker returns from capital markets, in contrast to maintaining a longer, five-ten year horizons for property investments and
* highly values convenience and low-zero fee propositions.

We know there was a flurry of new retail traders coming online in 2020 through 2022 when they found new interests during extended COVID lockdowns. But have enough retail traders stayed active and with our narrowly defined prospective trader, would there still be a TAM worth going after?  

If we look to the US for perspective, the Australian retail trade total addressable market could be AUD 200 million - 1 billion per year.

# Bull and bear cases for a brokerage disrupting the Australian market

Regardless of whether our hyper-focused, lean-featured brokerage offered Aussies US or Australian trading opportunities, the market is sizeable enough for this concept to be commercially viable.

---

## **The Bull Case: Why Disruption Might Work**

### 1. Underserved customers

* Younger investors prefer speed, clarity, and mobile-first convenience.
* Legacy platforms like Selfwealth often feel clunky or unintuitive.
* There’s appetite for something as clean as **Robinhood**, but built with Australian context.

### 2. Lean MVPs Can Work *If* the Scope Is Right

* By **deeply understanding one segment**, a new player can outperform incumbents bloated with legacy UX.
* When it launched in 2015 Robinhood prioritised frictionless onboarding experience and underweighted features like options trading, charting and technical indicators capabilities ([businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171213005259/en/Robinhood-Launches-Commission-Free-Options-Trading?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Robinhood Launches Commission-Free Options Trading")).
* By focusing on a highly usable app, Robinhood has attracted a demographic that values zero fees over deal-flow revenues and shown that Commsec doesn't need to be replaced in order to compete with it.

### 3. Precedent in Other Markets

* Robinhood, Public, SoFi, and others succeeded in the US despite huge incumbents like Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Interactive Brokers.
* Webull is expanding rapidly with slick UX and zero commissions — showing that even late entrants can win.

### 4. Rising Discontent With the Status Quo

* Selfwealth has a loyal base but dated UX.
* Stake has faced criticism for support, custody structures, or platform speed.
* Many users still maintain **multiple brokerage accounts** — a signal that nobody’s winning all their trust.

---

## **The Bear Case: Why Disruption Might Fail**

### 1. The Feature Paradox

* Traders equate features with trust and legitimacy. A minimal MVP might feel incomplete or unsafe — especially where real money is involved.
* Licensing (AFSL), custody models, KYC/AML, and t reporting complexity all raise the barrier to entry.
* Lean approaches often underestimate these burdens.

### 2. High Switching Costs

* Users are slow to move once funds are deposited, especially with tax reporting and portfolio history tied to current brokers.

# Conclusion

I think there's enough of a bull case that a Australian-based brokerage focusing on 1.5 - 2 million actively trading Australian adults, providing them with a lean-featured, UX-optimised, no-fee, US markets-only platform would significantly disrupt the Australian retail trading landscape.
